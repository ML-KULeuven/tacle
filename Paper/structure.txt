Learn constraints from data
---------------------------

- Problem statement
1) Discover or reconstruct structural relations in flat, tabular data [in a general way that allows declarative specification of constraints to discover]

- Why?
1) File generated from model, model got lost - > reconstruct
2) Constraint programming is hard - is Excel hard?
3) Avoid manual analysis, provide selection of constraints
4) Error checking
5) Completion, gain speed and insights
(Complicated constraints, also complicated to verify, too much output)

- Why is it new?
1) Unsupervised setting
2) Numeric, different constraints
3) Data format (2D)
4) Declarative, general / modular, stacking of constraint problems

- Approach
1) Notation
2) Algorithm (select constraints, find assignments, find solutions)

- Experimental questions
1) How accurate are we? (Accuracy / recall)
2) How fast are we and which factors affect the runtime (how)?
3) How general is our approach, what limitations are there?
